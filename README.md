# HubbleCommand.github.io

Repo for my portfolio.

Now moving to doing tests locally, so should have much fewer commits here!

Once you have cloned, run `bundle install` to install the necessary dependencies.

To start the server, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --host=0.0.0.0`

Once the server is started, can navigate to : http://localhost:4000/

## [Hacker Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)
There's a template to link google analytics, which I've removed, but see [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker#customizing) on how to add it (will also require adding removed files).
