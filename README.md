Repo to track projects & babble.

# Running Locally

Install the dependencies, [official Jekyll tutorial here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), or from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

Once you have cloned, run `bundle install` to install the necessary dependencies.

To start the server, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --host=localhost`

Once the server is started, can navigate to : http://localhost:4000/

## Updating dependencies

You can update gems, packages, and other dependencies with `bundle update`.
