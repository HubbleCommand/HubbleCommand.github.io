# HubbleCommand.github.io

Repo for my portfolio.

Now moving to doing tests locally, so should have much fewer commits here!

Once you have cloned, run `bundle install` to install the necessary dependencies.

To start the server, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --host=0.0.0.0`

Once the server is started, can navigate to : http://localhost:4000/
