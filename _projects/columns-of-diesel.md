After having tried to learn GameDev in Unreal Engine 4 for a few years, I'm finally gonna buckle down and do it.

I've used Unity quite a few times for simple games (2D & 3D) and AR applications, but I've always been amazed by the visual quality and possibilities within Unreal.

After having tried to follow the Udemy GameDev course 3 times and having to stop each time for various reasons, and after having tried some pretty hefty projects with procedural generation, I'm re-starting my Unreal journey with a simple project.

"Guide and Seek" is a really simple game with inspiration from the TV show [Stranger Things](https://www.netflix.com/fr-en/title/80057281), where Owen guides Bob through Hawkins Lab to avoid Demodogs.

The main goals are to get familiar with Unreal Engine 4, multiplayer, and game modding.
