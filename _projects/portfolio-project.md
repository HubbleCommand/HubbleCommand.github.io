This site is also a little project of mine to document my various exploits and projects that I do, mostly on the side. I do however document some of my larger Uni / Professional projects here. It's also a place for me to store general documentation on 

## Neat things done
- Dynamic filter: Sort Projects by category. Categories read from all projects dynamically.

## Encountered problems
- Placing images in _posts causes UTF-8 read errors. Putting them in a directory that is not a collection (i.e. /assets) corrects the issue.

## TODO
- [Pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)
- Translating, although I don't think it's possible with basic plan Github Pages
