This site is also a little project of mine to document my various exploits and projects that I do, mostly on the side. I do however document some of my larger Uni / Professional projects here.

Neat things done:
~Dynamic filter:
If there's one thing I hate, it's sites that just have glumps and pages of information with no means of sorting through it. 

Encountered problems:
Placing images in _posts causes UTF-8 read errors. Putting them in a directory that is not a collection (i.e. /assets) corrects the issue.
