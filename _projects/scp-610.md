Now that I have refamiliarized myself with Unreal Engine 4 with "Guide and Seek", time to start a bit of a more serious project.

[IGP](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheIndieGamePromoter) mentioned in one of his videos on SCP games (I think it was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWXAwaqMqzs&t) that most of the SCP games are very similar to [SCP: Containment Breach](https://www.scpcbgame.com/), with the same set of SCPs.
