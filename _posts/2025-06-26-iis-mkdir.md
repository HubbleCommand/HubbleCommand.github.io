title: "IIS Installation"

I had to install IIS one my work machine today, and for the life of me just could *not* get it to work.

It should not be that hard, just activate the feature in the Control Panel's Turn Windows features on or off program.
Buuut I kept getting an error.
I don't have the exact number on me, but it was due to missing .NET instillations, and *ancient* ones.
I also could not install those.

After umpteen hours, I finally stumbled upon [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46667628/error-0x800f0922-when-installing-iis-on-windows-10-the-changes-couldnt-be-com).

And lo and behold, just adding the `custerr\en-US` directory in `C:\inetpub\` fixed the issue.

But _HOW_?!??!
HOW, considering it creates a bunch of other directories itself?
It's just that it needs inetpub/custerr/en-US.
Legit it's so strange.

The only thing I can think of is that there was a security update a few months ago
[(article here)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-warning-dont-delete-that-weird-inetpub-folder-already-did-heres-your-fix/)
that added the `inetpub` folder.

I'm guessing that if the inetpub folder exists, the IIS installer assumes the other folders are just there, and crashes.
Although, it would be, ya know, *nice* if it gave a useful error that was actually related, cause it was most certainly *NOT* an issue with .NET.
