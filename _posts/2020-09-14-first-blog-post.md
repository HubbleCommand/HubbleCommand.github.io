Finally had time to work on this after I finished my Bachelor's in Sciences Informatiques et Sciences des Services. I have looked at various tools over the years and was skeptical by Jekyll at first, but it's honestly great. Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is far simpler than any other solution I've seen and I should be able to actually keep this up to date!

The prupose of this site is to record the various projects I do and have done.

Why a blog?
Do I think any odd schmuck should be posting on the internet? No, but I'll make an excpetion for myself. To be honest this is mostly a repository of the projects I've done, the blog is just an extra.
