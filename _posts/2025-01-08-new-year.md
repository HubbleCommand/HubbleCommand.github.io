## 2024 Recap
Exactly one year ago to the day, [I made a post on my plans for 2024]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-01-08-starting-again.md %}).
So, let's see how I got on.

First off, 2024 was certainly a year, and was far, far busier than I anticipated.
While I should have had much more time off work, it was quickly eaten up by more work, and a sleuth of family matters.
I was able to at least get some things done.

I finished my [image rotation for Godot](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/godot), after years of it stewing.

Game dev was excruciatingly slow, only finishing two Godot packages: [mobile_controls](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/mobile_controls) and [directional_sprites](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/directional_sprites).

I never got to work on mechatronics.

However, I am happy about the various smaller projects that I was able to finish:
- [preftils](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/preftils) and [preftils for flutter](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/preftils_fl)
- [VSCode run extension](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/run), which recently surpassed 25'000 users!
- Many contributions to update various [GDQuest open-source demos](https://github.com/gdquest-demos)
- I was able to clean up a *massive* amount of shit
- A whole lot of resource collection for Godot & general game dev
- [PrepaCH](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/PrepaCH) with NET MAUI
- Jekyll components: badges, icons, & video groups
- I actually posted a lot, writing more than 3x the amount of posts in 2024 that I had in all previous years combined (3 in 2020, 2 in 2021, and *17* in 2024)
- I was actually able to lose a good 6+kg


## 2025

Regardless, I'm dissapointed with 2024.

While I got things done, most of it was small things, and I didn't get any big projects done.

Without getting into too much detail, here's what I need to do in 2025.

### Focus

	<img src="/assets/images/start/STOP_TALKING_JUST_DO.jpg">
</div>

A very big issue in 2024 was constantly switching between projects, and just not having / making time.

While I don't have a concrete timeline of projects (because things never go as planned), I've at least set an order & priority on what I want to do.

### Game Dev

For 2025, there's 4 games that I want done on the tech side, of which 1 should be easy to have assets done for, and 2 of which don't need any at all.

### Personal

Lastly, I need to get to a stable weight of 170lbs.
