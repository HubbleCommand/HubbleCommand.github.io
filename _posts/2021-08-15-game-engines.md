Note that when going over this list, I am considering the actual quality of the engine, NOT its actual usefulness. You may personally find some engines here to be very useful compared to their ranking here.
While I may not be a senior game developper, . Do I feel like a competant authority? No. But the internet is where one man's trash is another man's... trash.


Unreal Engine - A very obivous first. An engine that gets constantly updated with industry firsts, with an incredibly compitant team

Flax - A quite new contender to the Game Engine Scene, 
An interesting feature is the support of bothe C++ and C# natively. This is similar to
Features: 

Godot - 
Godot, however, made a crucial mistake: making their own language, GDScript. While I can follow their reasoning, I find that it was more of a rushed method that eventually forced more work upon them, which is bad considering it is mostly volunteers.


Stride3D - . However it's UI system could use much work. Additionally, it has had a strenuous development, changing names and is not updated on a regular basis.
It is also missing many features like built-in multiplayer, but since it is built on .NET you can include a library like RSignal
It is completely free to use, supported solely through donations.


Unity - many may find it wierd thet Unity classes so low. Keep in mind, I do think Unity has it's place, Mobile, Web, and the trash.
However, anyone with either in-depth knowledge or who has tried to publish a game should be well versed
in the various issues that plague Unity.
Unity feels like Concrete5 : an immense backlog of bugs that will NEVER be fixed, and a seuth of features that you would expect the software to have
Stuff like:
- multiplayer : cool, finally MLAPI is coming, after literal YEARS of UNet being deprecated. Oh wait, it ISN'T made by Unity's team? They literally couldn't? 
	While I appreciate the use of open source stuff in general, it's honestly pathetic that the game engine with one of the strictist licensing policies can't seem to make their engine.
- splines : I mean for real, a public package, again, for free. Is Unity's team even trying? Something so simple, common, and standard?
- nested prefabs : BOTH Stride3d and Flax have this. Is Unity trying anymore?
Funilly enough, Concrete5 is licensed like stride : completely free, while Unity remains quite expensive compared to many other engines.
While I fell that the question "is x software ded" is semantically the same as a yo mamma joke, I honestly think that Unity's development is dead, and has been for years. With Unity's near refusal to do anything intersting with their engine, I feel that it will, eventually, go the way of all other ignored software : dead.


A few general notes:
- Both Stride3D and FlaxEngine are VisualStudio templates (ish), and are by far the lightest engines compared to the performance they deliver
- Unreal Engine is far above the competition. "Leaving in the dust" doeasn't do the teams behind unreal justice.
