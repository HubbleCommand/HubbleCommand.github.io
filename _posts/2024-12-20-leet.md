Horray, it's friday the 13th.

I recently saw the following clip:

Honestly, he can't be more correct.

However, my major gripe is that *so many* technical interviews have been so basic and were just leetcode style questions.
I had an interview at Snapchat that was just about program execution.

While important to know a candidat's grasp of basic concepts, one's ability to *design* and *understand* *systems* is, generally, much more important.
It's also what often differentiates the swarms of incompetent code monkeys from the *actual* engineers.

Another good approach is to ask candidates about complex subjects, like type erasure.
If the candidate is even aware of the concept, and can explain it, it's fair to assume that they are going to have a good grasp of basic concepts.
This can potentially save both sides hours of otherwise tedious interviews.

So, I guess one of my new year's resolutions is going to be to do LeetCode exercises; to hopefully avoid time-wasting interviews.
