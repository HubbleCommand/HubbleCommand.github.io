This is a post just so that I never forget the magnificience of [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

It is a massive boon when installing magnitudes of different build chains for different projects.

With the [extras](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FScoopInstaller%2FExtras%22) bucket, you also get a plethora of useful tools and apps like Inkscape and Gimp.

You even have buckets [for games](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCalinou%2Fscoop-games%22).
