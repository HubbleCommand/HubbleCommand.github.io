After a very hectic last few years between my military service, my own and family health issues, family deaths, and work, I'm finally going to start working on my own projects. To that end, I've reworked this blog; updating 3-year-old packages and updating the theme, as well as improving some previous posts.


## Rework Blog
The first step was just updating the ancient packages:
```
gem update
gem install bundler
bundle update
```
It took a minute to fix some conflicting versions, but I clearly got it working.

To spruce up the blog, I tested a few different themes. I tried [yat](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat), [moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk), and [dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash) themes, and I finished with using [hacker](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-hacker) because it's my favorite of the [supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/).

Lastly, there was quite a few files that I had just put at random for safe keeping (also so I could de-clutter my machine). I've re-written & re-formatted some of them, but I will continue to expand the project posts as I work on them.

## Change of the "blog"'s purpose
While I will continue to write my various rants in the blog format, this is also going to be where I write my own notes and documentaion on various tools, languages, and frameworks. This is mostly for my own future reference, and so that I don't end up having a bunch of text documents at random locations that I can never find when they would be useful.

## Projects

It's time for me to wipe the dust from a bunch of old projects that I never got to finish or even start on, and generally clear up a to-do list of interesting ideas that have been building up over the years.

### Contributing to Godot
While working on EVS, I needed to make a function to rotate images. I ended up doing it in C# as I didn't have the time to add it to the engine directly, but I'd like to spend time to re-write it in c++ and contribute it.

### Game dev
There's a backlog of games going back almost 5 years that I've either not finished, only done tech demos for, or not even started. I think the most important part will be to get back into artsy stuff to get them to look good, and to take more time off from work.

### Mechatronics projects
This year I should have more physical space to work on real-world projects like my abandoned drone projects. There's also lots of ideas I have on electric propulsion that I hope to play around with during the year (Q3/Q4).
