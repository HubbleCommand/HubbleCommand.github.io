Thought I'd make a quick post about an incredibly good and affordable cloud object storage solution that I don't see nearly enough people talk about: [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/).

It's not a full cloud solution, so don't expect any compute, SQL databases, VMs, or containers.

However, that isn't the point of Wasabi, nor is it why you should be interested.
It's selling point is the cost: $7 / Tb / month.
If that wasn't enough, there are *no egress or ingress fees*.

Additionaly, it uses the same API as AWS, making it a potentially easy switch.
Too bad if you use Azure.

When I first used Wasabi some 4 years ago, it was only a storage service.
While this remains to be the bulk, they have started offering other interesting solutions such as [Intelligent Media Storage](https://wasabi.com/cloud-object-storage/wasabi-air).
This might explain the price increase over the last years, as when I first used it it was $5 / Tb / month.

I don't know how they are able to keep it so cheap.
Even in my stress testing for requesting hundreds of Gbs of data at once, either from one or hundreds of sources, or one large or tens of thousands of smaller files, I had a more than acceptable data flow rate.

Wasabi has kept to it's primary product offering: extremely cheap cloud object storage.
You should definitely consider them.
