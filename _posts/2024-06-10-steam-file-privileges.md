title: "Steam Missing File Privileges"

For the last few months, I've had to run Steam in Administrator mode when installing or updating games. I despise doing that, but otherwise I'd always get the following error:
> "Missing file privileges"

It was by chance that I saw [this comment](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/3875967149490550448/#c3875967149490840342) in the Steam discussions:
> Steam requires at least 20% of the drive and 3 times the size of the game your are downloading/updating

While I still have a lot of space left, it wasn't 20% of the near 2TB drive.

I went and uninstalled a few hundred gigs of games I hadn't played in a while, and lo and behold, I could update games without Administrator mode...

It would be great if Steam could give the appropriate error. It's not an issue about file privileges, but about space...
