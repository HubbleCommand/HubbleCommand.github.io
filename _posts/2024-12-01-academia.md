Quick post following two things I saw, and can corroberate / relate to; the massive BS of academia research.
This article from Nature: [Nearly 50% of researchers quit science within a decade, huge study reveals](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03222-7), as well as the following video are pretty good to introduce parts of the issue if you aren't aware of it.

In most analyses of this issue, something that I think isn't driven home nearly enough though is how the *intent* of academic research has changed.
Research for the *sake* of research is rare.
Research is now for the *sake* of *positive* results.

I cannot express how against the scientific method this is, which is centered around *observation* in an attempt to remove cognitive biases.

What more bias could there be if you assume that your thesis is correct?
How are you *observing* if you're *twisting* your results?
How much more against the scientific method could you be?

A great example of this was my thesis.
It was simple: you reduce road congestion by better distribution through a road network's capacity.
For me, you could approach road congestion as any other type of resource allocation problem.
If you could implement a traffic management system to better allocate said resources, you could reduce congestion.

There was a bias in my thesis: I grew up in North America, where many major cities have grid-based road networks.
However, now that I live in Europe, I analysed the networks here as well, and there is major differences in network topology.
It is especially evident in old and smaller cities, where there are only so many road connections between regions due to space constraints.
Many road network topologies in Europe don't have some grid-based system where you could alleviate the general network by spreading out traffic, while still being able to reach a target destination without encountering similar agents.
There are many bottlenecks, negating any real benefit of this type of system.
One good exception is Barcelona, which is mostly grid-based.

There was another massive issue with my thesis: adoption.
While the premise is interesting (so much so that apparently Waze calculates ther users' routes in a similar way), the key issue is usage.
My simulations were fairly consistent accross the board:
for any real network-level effect, you would need at least 40% of users to adhere to the system's plan.
And even then, it entirely depended on the network's topology; in many cities, spatial dispersion just doesn't work, you would have to do it temporally.

With all that considered, my paper was pretty clear: this type of traffic management system, while *theoretically* interesting, would have very, very little applicability.
The amount of work and resources required to reach any sort of result would be immense, and wouldn't compare to, say, adding a few buses.
With any type of shared transport, you greatly reduce strain on the network.

However, I couldn't say that.
I was *explicitely* told that I had to have a positive result, because, and I quote, "it was such a good idea".
Even ideal macro-scale simulations that ignore any micro-level problems showed that the system was useless.

But no, I had to go and waste months more of my time saying how the system would be great for self driving cars or whatnot.

While bullshitting is an issue that plagues academia in general, IT has another problem; assuming every problem has an IT solution.
And more often than not, that the IT solution is *better*.
