For some reason, Android Studio doesn't have built-in support to preview [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

But, I hear you say, "look here, there is a plugin!" [*](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7793-markdown).

You are correct!
However, already in the overview, there's a link to a fix for the preview not working in Android Studio [*](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/159933628?pli=1#comment7).

The fix is very simple:
- Open `Actions` with `Ctrl+Shft+A`
- Then type `Choose Boot Java Runtime for the IDE`
- Now choose a runtime with [JCEF (Java Chromium Embedded Framework)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/embedded-browser-jcef.html), which is what is used for the preview.

However, it isn't fully-featured, notably with no iframe support!
Your only other option to embed videos is to use an image that *links* to the video.
This is what I did for my [Video Group component]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-06-09-jekyll-components.md %}).
You can also do the same thing in pure markdown:

```
{% raw %}
[![ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)
{% endraw %}
```

Even VSCode's preview (which you can enable with `Ctrl+Shft+V`) has security you can disable to load var

So, honestly, just use VSCode or your preferred editor when working with Markdown.
