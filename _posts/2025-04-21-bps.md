I've worked in geospatial for a few years, and have stumbled into specializing in it as a software dev / engineer.

As such, I'm always intrigued by the new systems and tech getting put out.
When the ESA started rolling out testing for their
[HAS system](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/galileo/services/galileo-high-accuracy-service-has),
I researched integrating it into my then-employer's applications.
It's really cool because you can get RTK-like systems solely through satellite,
although at the time the expected accuracy was still 10cm+, compared to RTK's 5cm-.

But I recently read [this article](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/bps-gps-alternative-nobodys-heard) on BPS.

[Here's the National Association of Broadcasters page on BPS](https://www.nab.org/bps/)

[Here's a BPS analysis peer reviewed paper](https://www.nab.org/bps/ITM25-0009.pdf).

While *interesting*, my issue is that it's being presented as *new* and *inventive* (key point, not *innovative*, but *inventive*).
It's basically delivering a timing payload like GPS over a 
[Gee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gee_(navigation))
or [LORAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LORAN)
-like system.
