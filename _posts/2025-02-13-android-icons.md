In all of my Android jobs, I've always been given the assets to use by our UX teams.
The process is easy: download whatever assets I'm supposed to use, import them, and use them.

So, recently, for my own projects. I've just been using [Google Font Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
I follow my same old process of downloading whatever I need, then importing it.

Yet low and behold, my inadequacy is showing yet again:
I can get the exact same icons within Android Studio.

In `res / drawable`, do `New` -> `Vector Asset`.

In the Asset Studio window, the `Clip Art` option gives you what I assume is the exact same damned list.
You also get all the same modification options as you do on the site.

The more your know?
The more I *should* know more like.
