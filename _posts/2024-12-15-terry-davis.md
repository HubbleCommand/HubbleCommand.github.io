Youtube has recently been suggesting some videos to me about [Terry Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis).
Fitting, I guess, given that it is, or would have been, his birthday.

If you don't know his story, I highly suggest you look into him [[*]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMUhbIAA9-8).
While certainly a peculiar character, he definitely left his mark, his magnum opus being TempleOS.
It's a monument to what intelligence and dedication can result in when mixed with Schizophrenia.

On the one hand, he's a model software engineer; on the other, he's a model of what not to be as a person.
While not mean, he was in no way stable.
Truly the duality of most talented software engineers.

Here's a few of my favorites:

Jonathan Blow is someone that's sort of in the same vein, just not schizophrenic.
