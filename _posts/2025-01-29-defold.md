> I have a follow-up post [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-03-27-defold.md %})

This is a continuation of [my post on general game engines and frameworks]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-08-15-game-engines.md %}).

After having moved away from Godot due to issues I've detailed elsewhere, Defold seemed like a good choice.
More than a month in, and pretty much all of the issues I had with Godot are nonexistent.
While it lacks features available elsewhere, those it does have are *extremely stable*.
It also has a massive amount of official integrations.


## Issues

Before going ahead, let me get what I don't like out of the way.

Defold's editor isn't made with the Defold engine, but with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).
I think it's a missed opportunity to [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food),
but Defold doesn't have the built-in UI system to actually MAKE an editor.
I sort of understand, as Defold is supposed to be a framework to make performant games, NOT full-fledged applications.

My major gripe is the use of "magic strings".
It's very error-prone, and makes it difficult to track what global strings you have.

That's it.
I may have some gripes with usability within the editor (like not being able to search for input keys) but it's not nearly as bad as some people find it.


## Learning / Knowledge Base

- [Building blocks of Defold](https://defold.com/manuals/building-blocks/)
- [Components](https://defold.com/manuals/components/)
- [Official Defold Tutorials](https://defold.com/tutorials/)
- [Repo of Defold samples](https://britzl.github.io/publicexamples/)
- [Monetization](https://defold.com/manuals/ads/)
- [Defold Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@DefoldTutorials) channel
- [Defold for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4_orbQ0JeQtynHimL-r8DUqH5Jf_RHZ2) playlist
	(+ [missing part 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OTxUPEu_s4&ab_channel=UnfoldingGamedev))
- [Window Callbacks](https://defold.com/ref/alpha/window/#window.set_listener:callback)
- Messaging: `#` is for the specific script, `.` is to the script's owning game object meaning it will go to all components [*](https://defold.com/manuals/message-passing/)
- There are limits on physics worlds [*](https://forum.defold.com/t/physics-world-buffer-full-world-could-not-be-created/144/10)

Honestly, just follow the samples, and I highly, highly recommend just doing the official tutorials.
They are clear and complete enough for getting yourself off the ground.
Only once you want to know more complex subjects should you look elsewhere, and honestly most of it won't be Defold-specific.

It's also good to look at the [official creator spotlight blog posts / interviews](https://defold.com/blog/#creator%20spotlight):
- [Void Scrappers post mortem](https://defold.com/2022/11/24/Void-Scrappers-post-mortem/)
- [Choosing Defold for Steam games production - the story of Luden.io](https://defold.com/2023/09/07/Defold-x-Luden-io/)

### Scences, Worlds, and Switching Scences

The last (or first) concept is that of Collections.
While a Game Object can be seen as a group of Components, a Collection is pretty much just a group of Game Objects.
However, you may quickly find that you can only have *one* scene defined in the bootstrap.

Switching scences is done through a [Collection Proxy](https://defold.com/manuals/collection-proxy/) [(example)](https://defold.com/examples/collection/proxy/).

### Lua

[Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) is a great resource covering the very basics to more advanced topics.
Lua is very similar to Javascript as they are both prototype-based.

Some notes:
- nil is the only value that is treated as false (0 and empty strings are thuthy)
- indexes start at 1, or any index you set (I wanna cry)
- ternary operators might as well not exist
- [metamethods](http://lua-users.org/wiki/MetamethodsTutorial)
- [performance tips](https://www.lua.org/gems/sample.pdf)

### Input

- [General Manual](https://defold.com/manuals/input/)
- [Mouse and Touch](https://defold.com/manuals/input-mouse-and-touch/) (finally, considered to be the same!)
- [Extension](https://defold.com/assets/defoldinput/)
- [Mouse and touch events sample](https://defold.com/examples/input/mouse_and_touch/)
- [Down duration sample](https://defold.com/examples/input/down_duration/)

Note: for text inputs, use something like [Druid](https://gamefromscratch.com/defold-druid-ui-framework/),
because building it all yourself looks tedious [[*]](https://forum.defold.com/t/android-keyboards-input/24798)

### Collision Groups & Masks [[*]](https://defold.com/manuals/physics-groups/)

Two things that aren't clear in the docs:
- An entity can have many groups & masks by seperating groups with a comma
- Note that there is a max of 16 layers

### Rendering & the 2D Camera System

The system is *there*, but I find it fucky and not super friendly out-of-the-box.
It's very customizable, and most importantly well documented, so do please [read the render pipeline manual](https://defold.com/manuals/render/).
Also, make sure to read the [camera manual](https://defold.com/manuals/camera/).


## Missing Features

### Internationalisation

A very important feature that doesn't exist in the editor is the ability to translate text.
There is an [asset that wraps i18n](https://defold.com/assets/i18n-defold/),
however this still requires you to set Text nodes' text property values through scripts.

### Physics interpolation

Godot only [recently added 2d physics interpolation](https://godotengine.org/releases/4.3/#highlights-2d-physics-interpolation).
Defold doesn't *really* have this, but you can fake it with kinematic physics, `update()`, and `fixed_update()`.
You can read more in [this thread](https://forum.defold.com/t/kinematic-movement-interpolation-and-fixed-update/73297).

### Screen to world & other camera helpers

While very easy to do yourself, I don't know why this isn't just built into the engine.
Check out the [sample](https://defold.com/examples/render/screen_to_world/) on how to do it
[(source)](https://github.com/defold/sample-screen-to-world-coordinates).

### Lighting<a href="#lighting"><img width="15" height="15" style="padding-left: 15px;" src="/assets/images/link.svg"></a>

This will *require* knowledge of shaders.
Please read the [manual](https://defold.com/manuals/shader/)
as well as [this amazing post](https://forum.defold.com/t/shaders-for-beginners/66622).
There are also some very good examples:
[lightning vfx](https://defold.com/2024/03/14/Lightning-VFX/),
[pixel planets](https://github.com/selimanac/defold-pixel-planets),
and [animal crossing world bending](https://forum.defold.com/t/curved-world-shader-effect-200-bounty-completed/73464)

For lights in particular, there are the videos below, as well as the
[2D lights sample](https://britzl.github.io/Lights/) [(source)](https://github.com/defold/sample-lights-and-shadows),
[britzl's post about this sample](https://forum.defold.com/t/2d-lights-and-shadows-sample),
and this [detailed post on pixel-perfect shadows](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/2D-Pixel-Perfect-Shadows).

{% assign lighting_ids="oLiJTcdBCkM,sLFHDihszfc,_JDKVSTt1Fo,bG1IJDBHwHg,rzm8v5gx7l0" | split: "," %}
{% include /components/video-group.html id="vglighting" ids=lighting_ids %}


## Performance

Defold is highly, highly opinionated, mostly to make it as performant as possible.
Unlike many other projects, Defold's manuals will generally tell you what to do.

Debug mode performance is expectedly bad, but release mode is better than Godot, with a 1/6th of the memory impact.
I'll need to investigate CPU usage differences more thoroughly.
[Bunnymark](https://defold.com/examples/sprite/bunnymark/) is a funny benchmark, able to render 2^15 bunnies, so do check it out.

Size is very important, and the [resource manual page](https://defold.com/manuals/resource/) covers this very well.
Do note that you should use a low amount of atlases [*](https://forum.defold.com/t/spawning-multiple-enemy-types/7861/2).

### Performance - Collections vs Game Objects

Use Game Objects where possible.
Collections are scenes / worlds, so use them for that purpose; it isn't great to use them as a holder for complex Game Objects.
You also get performance hits when messaging between all the game objects / components / scripts, so centralize things as much as possible.

Some things to consider from [this post](https://forum.defold.com/t/game-object-or-collections-best-practices/41306/3):

> "game objects are cheap"

> Multiple scripts controlling different parts of an entity
> This could potentially have a bit of negative impact on performance, especially if you have a lot of messages going back and forth between the different scripts on a game object. Also if you have multiple scripts youâ€™ll end up with multiple transitions from engine native code across the boundary to the Lua lifecycle functions. The more you can collect your logic in a single script the better.


## Patterns

*Please* read [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html).
Design Patterns are, generally, a good way to solve a common problem with a common solution.
While each solution will invariably be *similar* in each language, framework, or tool, there will invariably be changes to make to appropriate it to the environment.
This is particularly important for Defold, as the scripting language, Lua, is prototype-based.
While you can emulate classes, do try to use the natural syntax of the language [*](https://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html).

Godot is a good example of pattern appropriation, where a
[Finite State Machine](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/design-patterns/finite-state-machine/)
can be implemented by each state being it's own node.

I'm going to go over some of the most important design patterns, and how you can appropriate them in Defold.

### Object Pooling

Unity is the token child of object pooling [[1]](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-object-pooling).
However, do NOT implement this in Defold, unless you are in the native c/c++ side.
Defold already does some form of object pooling under the hood (according to Britzl), so doing it yourself on the scripting side is not going to give you any real improvements.

### Command

[Command](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command) is a vague pattern for what can be seen as messaging.
It is also a very important for lua as well [*](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Lua/Lua_best_practice#Patterns).
[GDQuest has a good overview of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP5_97-iah4) for use in games.

### State

State patterns like [FSMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) are probably the most prevailent pattern.
There are some minor things to consider when using it in defold [*](https://forum.defold.com/t/how-to-make-a-state-machine/71324).

{% assign state_ids="Hb3GEcTgkrg" | split: "," %}
{% include /components/video-group.html id="vg-state" ids=state_ids %}

### Data Driven Design / Data Oriented Programming

This is probably the most important, watch [Nic Barker's video for a breakdown of why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwkuAqObplU).
Some game engines have built-in systems that simplify this pattern.
Notably, Unity has [Scriptable Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPXvoWVabPY), and
Godot has [Custom Resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRZjM9MTGw).

Defold doesn't have any systems like this, BUT, if you want editor support, you can use [`go.property`](https://defold.com/manuals/script-properties/).
I think using asset packs with Textures & JSON files is good enough, especially when delivered through [Live Update](https://defold.com/manuals/live-update/).
However, there are three ways to include resources: compiled-in, compiled custom, & bundled:

| ![](https://defold.com/manuals/images/bundling/bundle_schematic_01.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *[image comes from this manual](https://defold.com/manuals/bundling/#the-bundle-layout)* |

While there are [some tools](https://github.com/JustAPotota/Unfold)
that allow directly modifying the archive formats, I don't recommend it.
If you want your game to be *easily* moddable, then you need to consider the modifiability of these approaches:

| Characteristic | Custom Resources | Bundle Resources |
|:--:| 
| Modify files after bundling | No - files stored inside a binary archive | Yes - files stored on the local file system

*For easy modding support* use bundled resources.
Add the paths of your assets (relative to the project root) in `game.project` -> Project -> Bundle Resources.
Then, the raw files will be available within the build.
This means it should be relatively easy to manage data packs through something like [mod.io](https://mod.io/).
- [Resources manual](https://defold.com/manuals/resource/)
- [Bundle Resource Project Setting](https://defold.com/manuals/project-settings/#bundle-resources)
- [Working with bundled files manual](https://defold.com/manuals/file-access/#bundle-resources)
- [mod.io REST API](https://docs.mod.io/restapiref/#getting-started)
- [Steamworks Workshop documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop)

A *possible* restriction is Defold-type resources can't be put here, i.e. Atlases or Collections.
This is based on some old posts by Britzl, but recent changes allow runtime generation of resources like Atlases:
- [Packing an atlas at runtime](https://forum.defold.com/t/packing-an-atlas-at-runtime/72736)
- [Defold asset to do this](https://github.com/Jerakin/defold-runtime-atlas)


## What's left

I'll be doing more things in the project section of the site about Defold later on as projects progress.
However, that's it for this post, as it's given a good overview of what I've figured out and the most important resources.
